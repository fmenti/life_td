Tutorials
=========

Curious to see an example with a more detailed workflow? There are several Jupyter notebooks with tutorials available:

.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   tutorials/first_example.ipynb
   tutorials/life_td_access.ipynb
   tutorials/starcat4.ipynb

* :ref:`First example: life_td data generation </tutorials/first_example.ipynb>`  (:download:`download notebook </tutorials/first_example.ipynb>`)
* :ref:`Access life_td </tutorials/life_td_access.ipynb>`  (:download:`download notebook </tutorials/life_td_access.ipynb>`)
* :ref:`LIFE-StarCat generation </tutorials/starcat4.ipynb>`  (:download:`download notebook </tutorials/starcat4.ipynb>`)

The notebooks can also be viewed on `Github  <https://github.com/fmenti/life_td/tree/master/data_generation/docs/source/tutorials>`_. In 2024 I gave a 15 minute presentation on the LIFE-StarCat during one of the LIFE science team meetings which you can watch on `Youtube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqYf2tvb5OQ&t=616s>`_ . There I basically walk you through the LIFE-StarCat generation notebook.
